# Card Match Game – Prototype Assignment

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to streamline the evaluation process for both parties. By completing this assignment, you will gain insight into our expectations for potential team members, while allowing us to focus our time on candidates who are genuinely interested in collaborating with us.

This is **not a speedrun**. Please make good use of the allotted time and focus on writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.

## Project Overview

You are required to develop a **functional prototype of a card-matching game**.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Engine**
   - Develop the project from scratch using:
     - **Unity 2021 LTS**, or
     - **Cocos Creator 3.8**
   - Avoid prebuilt frameworks or purchased assets.

2. **Gameplay & Animations**
   - Smooth gameplay with animations for card flipping and matching.
   - The system must allow continuous card flipping without forcing the player to wait for card comparisons to complete.

3. **Flexible Layout System**
   - Support multiple grid layouts (e.g., `2x2`, `2x3`, `5x6`, etc.).
   - Cards should automatically scale to fit the available display area (screen or container widget).

4. **Persistence**
   - Implement a **save/load system** to persist player progress between game restarts.

5. **Scoring**
   - Include a scoring system.

6. **Audio**
   - Add basic sound effects for:
     - Card flip
     - Match
     - Mismatch
     - Game over  
   - Limit sound effects strictly to these four cases.

7. **Version Control (Git)**
   - Git usage is **mandatory**.
   - Create a **public repository** with a **random, obscure name** that does not reveal the nature of the game.
     - This helps prevent others from leveraging your code post-submission.
   - Commit **frequently** with **clear, meaningful commit messages**, as if working in a team.
   - The **first commit must be an empty Unity project**, clearly marking the start of your work.
     - Do **not** upload a fully functional project in the first commit.
   - Commit history will be reviewed as part of the evaluation.

## Scope & Expectations

1. **Gameplay Focus**
   - Focus solely on gameplay.
   - A menu system is optional but considered a plus.

2. **Scoring System**
   - Mandatory.
   - A combo system is an added advantage.

3. **Stability**
   - The project must run without crashes, errors, or warnings.

4. **Platform Support**
   - Must run on:
     - Desktop, and
     - Either **Android** or **iOS**

5. **Code Quality Over Visuals**
   - As this is a simple game, emphasis is placed on:
     - Code structure
     - Performance
     - Optimization
     - Maintainability  
   - Visual polish is secondary.

## Notes

Please approach this assignment as a real production task. Clean architecture, optimized systems, and thoughtful commit history are highly valued.
